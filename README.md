# Backlog.js

Backlog.js is a auto-magical document for [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) user stories, sprints and terms.

## Features

- Easy to use: no fiddling with Calc or Excel
- Standalone: works offline and online
- Responsive: works on pretty much all devices
- Printable: generate a PDF or ink some paper (results vary)

## Quick Start

Once installed you can start:

- in standalone using `cake build` and open `public/index.html`
- in server mode using `cake watch` and open [http://localhost:9000]()

To save your work in standalone mode hit `Save` in the toolbar and overwrite your `backlog.js`, which serves as database. In server mode this is not necessary (but not yet implemented!).
